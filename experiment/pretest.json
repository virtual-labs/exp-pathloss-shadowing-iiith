      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pathloss = Tx power - Rx power = 50 - 40 = 10 dB.",

      "question": "Why is the decibel (dB) scale commonly used to represent pathloss and signal strength?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It makes the numbers larger and easier to read",
        "b": "It allows multiplicative gains and losses to be handled via simple addition and subtraction",
        "c": "It is a linear scale that represents absolute power levels",
        "d": "It eliminates the need for complex mathematical models"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The scale actually compresses large ranges of values into smaller, manageable numbers.",
        "b": "Logarithmic scales convert multiplication of power ratios into addition of dB values, simplifying link budget analysis.",
        "c": "The dB scale is logarithmic, not linear.",
        "d": "Mathematical models are still required; the scale just changes how values are represented."

      "question": "Which of the following best describes the difference between large-scale fading and small-scale fading?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Large-scale fading occurs over long distances; small-scale fading occurs over very short distances (wavelength scale)",
        "b": "Large-scale fading is due to multipath; small-scale fading is due to pathloss",
        "c": "There is no physical difference; the terms are interchangeable",
        "d": "Small-scale fading describes the average signal power over a large area"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Large-scale fading (pathloss and shadowing) represents mean signal change over distance, while small-scale fading involves rapid fluctuations due to multipath interference.",
        "b": "This is reversed; multipath causes small-scale fading.",
        "c": "They represent different physical phenomena and statistical models.",
        "d": "That is the definition of large-scale fading."
