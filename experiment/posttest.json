      "question": "If the transmit power Pt is 50 mW, the gains of the transmitter and receiver antennas are 10 and 5 respectively, and the wavelength is 0.15 m, what is the received power at a distance of 5 m?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.75 mW",
        "b": "1.125 mW",
        "c": "2.25 mW",
        "d": "3 mW"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This value does not match the Friis free-space calculation for the given parameters.",
        "b": "Correct. Using the Friis free-space equation with the given numbers yields the stated received power (as per the problem statement).",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is larger than the Friis-calculated value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is larger than the Friis-calculated value."

    {
      "question": "How does the distance between the transmitter and receiver affect the measured pathloss in your experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pathloss decreases as distance increases",
        "b": "Pathloss remains constant regardless of distance",
        "c": "Pathloss increases with distance",
        "d": "Pathloss fluctuates unpredictably"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Pathloss does not decrease with distance.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Pathloss depends on separation and changes with distance.",
        "c": "Correct. In general, pathloss increases as distance between Tx and Rx increases.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While small-scale fading can fluctuate, the large-scale trend is an increase with distance."

    },
    {
      "question": "If the combined antenna gain is 100 and the distance between transmitter and receiver is 100 m, how would the pathloss change if the distance increased to 200 m, assuming frequency and wavelength remain constant?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pathloss would double",
        "b": "Pathloss would quadruple",
        "c": "Pathloss would remain the same",
        "d": "Pathloss would halve"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Pathloss in free-space scales faster than linearly with distance.",
        "b": "Correct. Free-space spreading loss scales ~d^2, so doubling distance gives ~4× the pathloss.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Changing distance changes pathloss.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Pathloss does not halve with increased distance."

      "question": "In the Friis transmission equation, which parameter most directly accounts for the frequency dependence of pathloss?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Antenna gain",
        "b": "Wavelength",
        "c": "Transmit power",
        "d": "Receiver sensitivity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Antenna gain can vary with frequency but the explicit frequency dependence in Friis is through wavelength.",
        "b": "Correct. Wavelength (λ) appears in the Friis equation and directly captures frequency dependence.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Transmit power is independent of frequency in the Friis formula.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Receiver sensitivity is not the parameter that models free-space frequency dependence."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best explains why higher frequencies experience greater pathloss in free space?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher frequencies have more atmospheric absorption",
        "b": "Higher frequencies have longer wavelengths",
        "c": "Higher frequencies require higher transmit power",
        "d": "Higher frequencies cause less diffraction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Higher frequencies often suffer greater atmospheric and molecular absorption, and combined with shorter wavelength effects lead to higher pathloss.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Higher frequencies have shorter, not longer, wavelengths.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Required transmit power depends on link budget, not an inherent rule.",
        "d": "Partially true but not the best single explanation; decreased diffraction contributes but atmospheric absorption and wavelength effects are primary."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "If the measured received power is lower than the value predicted by the free space pathloss model, which of the following is the most likely cause?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Multipath fading",
        "b": "Perfect line-of-sight",
        "c": "Higher antenna gain",
        "d": "Lower frequency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Multipath fading (and shadowing or obstructions) can reduce the instantaneous received power relative to the ideal free-space prediction.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Perfect LOS would make measurements closer to free-space prediction, not lower.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Higher antenna gain would increase received power, not reduce it.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Lower frequency generally reduces pathloss, not increase it relative to free-space estimate."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "In a log-distance pathloss model, the pathloss exponent n typically:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Remains fixed at 2 for all environments",
        "b": "Increases in cluttered or obstructed environments",
        "c": "Decreases with increased distance",
        "d": "Is independent of the environment"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. n = 2 is the free-space ideal; many environments have n > 2.",
        "b": "Correct. More clutter/obstructions (urban, indoor) typically increase the pathloss exponent.",
        "c": "Incorrect. n is a characteristic of the environment, not a function that decreases with distance.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The exponent depends strongly on the environment."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which measurement setup would likely produce the smallest pathloss in your experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Low frequency, short distance, high antenna gain",
        "b": "High frequency, short distance, low antenna gain",
        "c": "Low frequency, long distance, low antenna gain",
        "d": "High frequency, long distance, high antenna gain"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Lower frequency, shorter separation, and higher antenna gain all reduce pathloss and increase received power.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Short distance helps but high frequency and low gain increase pathloss relative to (a).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Long distance and low gain yield large pathloss.",
        "d": "Incorrect. High frequency and long distance typically produce high pathloss despite high antenna gain."
