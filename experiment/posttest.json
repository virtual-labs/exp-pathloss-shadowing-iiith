      "question": "How does the distance between the transmitter and receiver affect the measured pathloss in your experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pathloss decreases as distance increases",
        "b": "Pathloss remains constant regardless of distance",

      "question": "If the combined antenna gain is 100 and the distance between transmitter and receiver is 100 m, how would the pathloss change if the distance increased to 200 m, assuming frequency and wavelength remain constant?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pathloss would double",
        "b": "Pathloss would quadruple",

        "a": "Pathloss is proportional to $d^2$, so doubling the distance results in a fourfold increase in pathloss",
