      "question": "How does shadowing affect pathloss?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increases it in a predictable way",

      "question": "If the transmit power is 50 dBm and the received power is 40 dBm, what is the pathloss in dB?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pathloss = Tx power - Rx power = 50 - 40 = 10 dB.",
